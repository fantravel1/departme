## 🌍 Overview

**DepartMe.com** is a global, multilingual, static-content platform that generates travel journeys based on **emotional intention**, not geography.

Instead of asking:
- “Where do you want to go?”

DepartMe asks:
- **“Where do you need to go emotionally?”**

This is not therapy.  
It is not mental health advice.  
It is **experience design for emotional reset**.

DepartMe creates full journeys across:
- cities
- neighborhoods
- nature
- cafés
- sounds
- walking routes
- small rituals

It is **therapy-adjacent** in the sense that it helps people move through emotions—but it does so through travel, place, and experience.

## 🧠 Core Idea

You don’t choose:
- Paris
- Tokyo
- Mexico City
- Cape Town

You choose:
- **Disappear**
- **Heal**
- **Escape**
- **Explore**
- **Leap**

Then DepartMe builds a journey that matches.

### Phase 3 (Personalization)

- Accessibility and sensory sensitivity variants
- “micro-escapes” for locals (staycation emotional resets)

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

DepartMe is not trying to tell people what to feel.  
It is trying to give people **places that make feeling possible**.

LLMs are used to:
- match emotional states to environmental patterns
- generate ritual-based itineraries
- translate mood language across cultures
- cluster journeys by emotional outcome

Humans are required to:
- prevent harmful claims
- ensure cultural respect
- avoid mental health misinformation
- review content for safety and realism

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

DepartMe is built around **emotional and experiential entities**.

### Core Entities
- Mood State
- Journey Theme
- Destination
- Neighborhood
- Nature Site
- Café / Third Place
- Walking Route
- Ritual
- Soundscape
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links by emotion, environment, and travel style
- is programmatically generatable
